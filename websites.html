                <p id="web-text">This website was my first full length website. I collaborated with a school mate, Avery Seabolt, to design it. The project that was assigned to us was to make a website based off of an endangered species. However, I have a passion for environmental issues, so we decided to go with climate change. <br> This site used mostly HTML5 and CSS3, but it also has a small amount of JavaScript. </p>

                <h3>Digital Ethics</h3>
                <p>This website was designed to cover the entirety of digital ethics, so, as you would imagine, there were many pages and many collaboraters. The pages that I worked on were the main page of the site and the main page of the Digital Security portion of the site. <br> This site was made with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.</p>

                <p>Zen Garden is a CSS workshop where all of the HTML is already written, and the programmer is tasked with styling it. <br> This project used solely CSS3.</p>
