                <p id="write-text">I wrote this essay in the time right before the law that allowed marijuana to be used recreationally in California was passed. I was curious as to what the effects of the legalization would be, so I wrote an essay about it.</p>

            <p id="p1">Weed is the devil's lettuce, is incredibly unhealthy for you, and makes you into a terrible person... or not? The controversy of marijuana has always been a popular topic of conversation and debate, but recently, there has been a big change. Pot has been illegal since 1937, and ever since then, and even prior to that in certain states, smoking weed was a punishable crime."</p> <br> 
            <p id="p2">One of the first states to legalize weed was Washington. In Washington, pot has generated over $250 million in legal marijuana stores, and over $70 million in taxes. Also, violent crime has dropped by roughly 10%, and the Murder rate has gone down by 13% (Swanberg)! However,it has also given rise to a 28% increase in marijuana related DUI's (Swanberg).This illustrates almost perfectly how cannabis can have both a wonderfully positive and a harshly negative effect. However, it significantly decreased crime rates, and while it has increased the amount of DUI's, that doesn't mean it has increased the amount of harm dealt by pot. </p> <br>
            <p id="p3">Over 4.2 million people in the U.S. fit the criteria for abuse of marijuana, and those 4.2 million people have an addiction.Well, maybe not a chemical addiction that is the first thing that comes to mind when most people think of addiction, but a "habitual addiction", which is similar, because once you stop ingesting pot, you go through a withdrawal. We know this because not only have animal subjects shown symptoms of withdrawal from a "habitual addiction" to marijuana (Common symptoms of withdrawal from a "habitual addiction" include anger, decreased appetite, irritability, nervousness, and sleep difficulties ), but many people have reported going through it as well.</p> <br>
