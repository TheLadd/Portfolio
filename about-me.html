       <p class="row"> My name is Owen Ribera, and I am, among other things, a young website developer. I live in Fresno, California, and am, currently, a student of Clovis West High School. This is a website I made to showcase my work and promote my coding career, and you took the time to visit it, so thank you! Hopefully you want to hear about me, because that’s what the paragraphs below are about.</p>

<p>I’ve completed two full-length websites of professional quality. The first of which (and the one that I am more proud of) is a website about climate-change. Climate change has always been on my radar, as it affects everyone who lives on Earth, and I thought I would try to help raise awareness for it. The second was a group school assignment that focused on digital ethics. This site had a massive amount of information that was covered, and in turn, a massive amount of pages to cover that information. While I did not work on all of these pages directly, I did help direct the overall design of the website.</p>

<p>As an introverted nerdy person, I’ve always been drawn to computers. I spent a large amount of my childhood on computers, whether it was playing video games, typing essays, ordering illegal weaponry over the darknet (that was a joke. Hah. I’m hilarious), or talking to my friends over social media. Since I’ve spent so much time using them, I’ve been interested in what makes them work; the code. So, when I found out that the Center for Advanced Research and Technology offered a class for website development, I signed up as soon as I could. CART was my first experience with coding, though it most definitely won’t be the last. However, contrary to popular belief, my life isn’t defined by coding.</p>

<p>I have had two jobs in my high school career; a job at a local church as a barista and a job at Starbucks. I enjoyed the former more, but I enjoy the cash that the latter brings in much more than I enjoyed did serving coffee for free. I use the cash from my job to save up for college and a Nord Stage 3 (an electric piano), because I like knowledge (and the opportunities that accompany it) and I enjoy playing piano (but I suck. Like, a lot). I also use my income to subsidize my incessant coffee addiction, sometimes traveling across the state almost entirely to try some coffee that I saw someone rave about on a blog (millennials, right?).</p> 

<p>That’s about as much personal information about myself that I feel comfortable putting out on a public website, so I hope it was enough for you. However, I hope that you would take the time to look at the websites and other projects that I’ve completed over the years on the portfolio page.</p>
